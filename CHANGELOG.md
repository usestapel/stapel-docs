# Changelog

All notable changes to stapel-docs are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Pre-1.0 semver: **minor = breaking**, patch = compatible.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Resource invariants** (security audit DOCS-01): hard ceilings on every
  accepted byte — snapshot body, journal update and batch, upload blob and
  exporter input — plus an opt-in per-workspace stored-byte quota, all in
  the `STAPEL_DOCS` namespace (`MAX_BODY_BYTES`, `MAX_UPDATE_BYTES`,
  `MAX_UPDATES_PER_REQUEST`, `MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES`, `MAX_EXPORT_BYTES`,
  `WORKSPACE_QUOTA_BYTES`).
- **Upload sessions are capabilities, not slots**: a ticket carries an
  expiry (`UPLOAD_SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`), belongs to the user who opened it
  (anyone else needs workspace `manage`), accepts an optional declared
  sha256, and is consumed by a conditional state transition. Finalize
  validates the STORED object — existence, ceiling, declared size and
  checksum — before promoting it. Open sessions per workspace are capped
  (`MAX_PENDING_UPLOADS_PER_WORKSPACE`) and uploads can be restricted to a
  MIME allowlist (`UPLOAD_ALLOWED_MIME_TYPES`).

### Changed

- **`file` bodies have exactly one door.** `DocTypeSpec` gained
  `body_mutable`; the content PUT (and create-with-body) now refuses types
  that own their own write path — `type=file` (upload flow) and types whose
  spec vanished from the registry, which the storage verdict already
  promised were read-only. Revision restore replays already-accepted bytes
  and is unaffected.
- The upload ticket response carries `expires_at`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- **The stapel-core pin was a scaffold placeholder** (`>=0.3.0,<0.4`) that
  never got set: next to any real host (fleet services floor core at
  `>=0.18`) pip either refused to resolve or silently downgraded
  stapel-core to 0.3.2 — observed live while mounting docs into
  iron-recordings. Now `>=0.15.11,<1.0`, a measured floor: the full suite
  is green against 0.15.11, 0.16.0 and 0.18.0 (probed 2026-08-10); older
  cores are unmeasured and unclaimed.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-10

First release. Document/folder tree with versioning, exports, and the comm-bus
surface other modules need to attach documents to their own entities.

- **Versioning substrate** — document/folder models, `DOC_TYPES` registry,
  storage seam, authz choke point.
- **HTTP surface** — tree, content with optimistic locking, journal,
  revisions, trash, uploads.
- **Comm surface** — `docs.create_document` action, emitted-actions join
  point for other modules, GDPR anonymize provider, INGEST seam.
- **PDF exporter** — txt/md/csv via fpdf2 with bundled DejaVu unicode fonts.
- Full lifecycle proven end-to-end against a real host project (auth +
  workspaces + docs); contract quintet (`docs/{schema,flows,errors,capabilities,llms}`)
  drift-gated in CI.
